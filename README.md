# Sketch-Secrets

how to add secrets to your arduino sketch without sync with remote public repo.

after git clone... make a copy of `secrets.h.example` and rename to `secrets.h`

thanks to .gitignore rules `secrets.h` will be never synched to remote.

for reference, see: <https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore>
